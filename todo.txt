- The pending state. Theme it to look better.



It's funny I have a todo list to help me make my todo app.

- Make the search bar responsive to change. Already have it in the comments at the end of
  the browser_app.js.
- Make the fucking dates in the tasks themselves work. 
- Finish off the delete and edit buttons in the tasks
- Make complete tasks go to the complete tasks page so we can use that to show growth and streaks so as to turn it into a game.
- Reward user somehow.
- Start working with forks so as to gain recognition.
- Send deleted tasks to recycle bin and delete permanently after a while.
